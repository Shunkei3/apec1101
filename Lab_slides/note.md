# Questions:
+ By definition, opportunity cost is the cost of the next best alternative. According to this definition, for consumers, the opportunity cost of a good is the value of the next best alternative that they must give up to obtain that good. So, the opportunity cost is not the price of the good that the consumer has to pay. Is that correct?

+ Now, I am a bit confused. When you choose to buy a good, you compare the benefit you get from the good with the opportunity cost of the good. But, in economics, we need to think at the margin.
