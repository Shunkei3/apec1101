## Announcements {.center}

+ Assignment 2 is due on November 11th, Monday.
+ [**I will return Exam I at the end of class.**]{.text-orange}



## Do you remember what we did in the last lab? {.center}

+ We reviewed the concept of price elasticity of demand and how to calculate it.
  + You need to be able to explain the concept in words and be able to show the formula.

+ We did some exercise problems to practice calculating price elasticity of demand.
  + Midpoint method and Point method
  + Do you remember when to use the midpoint method and when to use the point method?

<br>

::: {.callout-important}
## Important!!!
+ Please solve the exercise problems we did in the last lab many times until you feel comfortable.
  + The solution was sent to you last week on Canvas.
:::
We will work on a similar problem today!

+ To be able to calculate price elasticity of demand with point method.

+ Quizzes to check your understanding
+ Practice Exercise 2: Price elasticity of demand along a linear demand curve.

+ I want to start with some quizzes to check your understanding. 
+ Then, we will move on to the exercise problems.

## {{< fa person-chalkboard >}} Quiz: Check Your Understanding {.center}

**Part 1.** Write down the formula for price elasticity of demand.

<br>

**Part 2.** The coefficient of price elasticity of demand is always negative. Why? (Answer with one sentence).

<br>

**Part 3.** Suppose the price of a product increases from $9 to $10, but the quantity demanded stays constant at 100 units. What type of price elasticity does this product exhibit? Draw the demand curve for this product.

<br>

**Part 4.** (*Important Question*) Is the following statement correct? If not, why?: "The price elasticity of demand is constant along a linear demand curve. True or False."

+ Maybe the similar questions will be on the next quiz.

**Part 4.** (*Important Question*) Is the following statement correct? If not, why?: "The price elasticity of demand is constant along a linear demand curve. True or False."

<br>

### Answer {.center}

[**False**. It varies along the demand curve]{.text-blue}.

<br>

### Why?

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
Recall the formula for price elasticity of demand:
$$
\text{Price elasticity of demand} = \frac{\% \Delta Q_D}{\% \Delta P} = \frac{\Delta Q_D / Q_D}{\Delta P / P} = \color{blue}{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{\Delta P}} \times \color{red}{\frac{P}{Q_D}}
$$

The price elasticity of demand is calculated with the product of two ratios: $\color{blue}{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{\Delta P}}$ and $\color{red}{\frac{P}{Q_D}}$.

Question

::::{.stopthink-container}
For a linear demand curve, [which ratio is constant and which ratio changes as we move along the demand curve?]{.text-orange}
::::
:::
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-up} 
+ the slope of the demand is consistent. So, $\color{blue}{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{\Delta P}}$ [is constant]{style="color:blue;"}.
+ But the ratio $\color{red}{\frac{P}{Q_D}}$ [changes as we move along the demand curve]{style="color:red;"}.
:::


## {{< fa person-chalkboard >}} Exercise 1: {.center}

Suppose you have the following demand equation $\color{blue}{Q_D = 500 - 5 P}$.

1. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when $\color{blue}{P = 40}$. What about when $\color{blue}{P = 60}$. 
2. At what price and quantity combination will the price elasticity of demand equal 1 (i.e., when demand is unit elastic)?
3. Since the demand curve is linear, explain how the elasticity of demand changes as we move along the demand curve.

:::{.notes}
+ Part 1: 
  + the elasticity of demand when P = 40 is -0.67, indicating that demand is inelastic at this price.
  + the elasticity of demand when P = 60 is -1.5, indicating that demand is elastic at this price.
+ Part 2: The price elasticity of demand is unit elastic when P = 50 and Q_d = 250.
+ What is the intuition behind the elasticity of demand changing as we move along the demand curve?
  + In general, demand is elastic in the upper half of any linear demand curve, so total revenue moves in the direction of the quantity change. Moving from point A to point B implies a reduction in price and an increase in the quantity demanded. Demand is elastic between these two points.

## Memo: 



## Elasticities Changes Along Demand Curve {.center}

Depending on the level of price ($P$) and quantity ($Q_D$), the price elasticity of demand changes. The figure shows the different elasticities of demand along the demand curve $Q_D = 500 - 5P$.

[**As the quantity demanded increases and price decreases along the demand curve, the demand becomes more inelastic.**]{.text-orange}

## Exam I {.center}

A couple of notes:

+ Ensure your exam score is the same as the score recorded on the Canvas site.
+ Make sure the points on your exam have been added correctly. If there is an error, please let me know, and I will correct it.
+ If you are satisfied with your exam score and you have no questions, you can leave the classroom and keep your exam.
