## Question (Review)
Suppose the demand and supply curves for T-shirts at a popular resort are given by the following equations: $\color{blue}{Q_d = 20,000 −500P}$ and $\color{blue}{Q_s = 5000+ 1000P}$.

Suppose and **excise tax of $2 is levied on the seller of T-shirts**. What will happen to the equilibrium price quantity of shirts in the market?
:::

<br>

### How did we derive the new supply curve?

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
$P$ is the price the seller receives from the buyer. [Out of the price $P$ the seller receives, $\$2$ goes to the government as tax]{.fragment .highlight-current-red}. Therefore, [the price the seller virtually receives is $P-2$]{.fragment .highlight-red}.
:::

<br>

:::{.fragment .fade-right}
So, the supply curve becomes $Q_s = 5000+ 1000\color{red}{(P-2)}$. Then, we derived the new equilibrium price and quantity by solving the new supply curve and the demand curve.

Suppose the demand and supply curves for T-shirts at a popular resort are given by the following equations: $\color{blue}{Q_d = 20,000 −500P}$ and $\color{blue}{Q_s = 5000+ 1000P}$.

1. Suppose that the government offers [a subsidy of $2 to the consumers]{.text-blue}. What is the new equilibrium price and quantity of T-shirts?
:::

<br>

Consumer pays $P$ to buy $Q_d$ T-shirts, but the government gives $$2$ to the consumer. Therefore, the price that the consumer virtually pays is $P-2$.

Therefore, the new demand curve is $Q_d = 20,000 - 500(P-2)$.

## Exercise Problem 2:

If the price of Thanksgiving turkeys increases, and the quantity of turkeys sold also increases, does this situation violate the law of demand?

<br>

+ **No**. During the Thanksgiving season, the demand for turkeys increases [because people are willing to pay more for turkeys to celebrate Thanksgiving (consumers' seasonal preferences, cultural traditions, etc.)]{.text-blue}. 
+ These non-price determinants of demand shift the demand curve to the right.

## Review: Change in Quantity Demanded vs. Change in Demand
*NOTE:* Same logic applies to Change in Quantity Supplied vs. Change in Supply.

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Change in Quantity Demanded 
Change in quantity demanded is caused by [a change in the price of the good]{.text-red}. It is represented by a movement along the same demand curve.

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
### Change in Demand
Change in demand means that the entire demand curve shifts. It is caused by [a change in a non-price determinant of demand (taste and preferences, income, etc.)]{.text-red}.

## {{< fa person-chalkboard >}} Question

Use supply and demand diagrams and verbal explanations to show the effect of the following events on the market for electric bicycles (e-bikes):

a. A new regulation significantly increases taxes on battery imports.
b. The price of public transportation fares is reduced.
c. A popular fitness trend encourages people to commute using environmentally friendly methods, such as e-bikes.
d. A technological advancement improves the battery life and charging speed of e-bikes.

## Exercise Problem 3 - Part a {.center}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

+ The higher cost of importing batteries leads to an increase in the overall production costs for e-bikes. As a result, at any given price, producers are willing to supply fewer e-bikes. 
+ This shifts the supply curve to the left.
+ As a result, the equilibrium price increases and quantity of e-bikes decreases.
