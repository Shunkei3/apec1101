1. **When the price of Chicken Sandwiches is $6 and the price of French Fries is $2 and the consumer's income is \$18, the consumer's utility-maximizing combination is (CS, FF) = (1, 6). Suppose that the price of French Fries increases to \$3, ceteris paribus. Does the consumer's utility-maximizing combination change? In order to attain a utility-maximizing combination, how will the consumer's consumption combination change?**


## In-class Exercise Problem 1 - Modified (Cont'd)

2. **Given the utility-maximizing combination you just found, what is the marginal rate of substitution of Chicken Sandwiches for French Fries?**

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
Before we start solving the problem, I want to check some important concepts with you.
:::


## 

:::{.ideas}
::::{.ideas-header}
Indifference Curve
::::
::::{.ideas-container}
**An indifference curve represents all the combinations of goods that give the consumer the same level of total utility**.

+ You can think of indifference curves like contour lines on a map in that they represent lines of equal "altitude" of utility.
::::
:::


<br>

### Important Characteristics that you should know (important!!)

:::{.fragment .fade-right}
1. The shape of an indifference curve is convex to the origin (downward sloping).
:::
:::{.fragment .fade-right}
2. The absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and it diminishes as we move down along the curve. (**Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution**)
:::
:::{.fragment .fade-right}
3. The level of utility represented by each curve increases as we move in a northeast direction.
:::


## Marginal Rate of Substitution

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
+ The **MRS of good X for good Y** indicates [how much of good Y a consumer is willing to give up in exchange for one more unit of good X while maintaining the same level of utility]{.text-blue}.

<br>


+ It diminishes as we move down along the curve. (i.e., **Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution**)

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
&rarr; For example. If you have less amount of Chicken Sandwiches, you are willing to give up more French Fries to get one more Chicken Sandwiches.

$$|\text{Slope of } l_1| > |\text{Slope of } l_2|$$
$$ \rightarrow MRS_{l_1} > MRS_{l_2}$$
:::

## Indifference Curve Map {.center}

There are lots of indifference curves representing different levels of utility!

![](./z_images/ic.jpeg){fig-width="70%" fig-align="center"}


## Utility Maximization: Indifference Curve and Budget Constraint {.center}

::: {.callout-important}
## I want you to understand the following concepts:

1. The [marginal rate of substitution (MRS)]{.text-red} is the slope of the indifference curve.

+ it represents rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility.

2. When the consumer is maximizing utility, [his indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint]{.text-red}.

3. Therefore, [the MRS at the utility-maximizing combination is equal to the slope of the budget constraint]{.text-red}.

## Graphical Explanation

![](./z_images/p1_annimate.gif){fig-align="center"}


## Utility Maximizing Combination

Utility is maximized when the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint.

## In-class Exercise Problem 1 (Cont'd) 

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
:::{.ideas}
::::{.ideas-header}
Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)
::::
::::{.ideas-container}
Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) of good X for good Y means the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade good X for good Y while remaining indifferent. 

+ Remember that an indifference curve shows all the combinations of goods that give the consumer the same level of utility. So, **the slope of the indifference curve is the MRS**.

## In-class Exercise Problem 4a


Assume Tim purchases milk, and eggs, a gallon of milk costs \$5 and each egg costs \$1. Assume that Tim's utility-maximizing combination is (milk, eggs) = (4, 10).

Draw a budget constraint for Tim who has a weekly income of \$30. Also, draw an appropriate indifference curve for Tim when he is maximizing his utility (Your indifference curve does not have to be precise, but it should have some specific characteristics). 


## In-class Exercise Problem 2 and 3 (if we have time)

Suppose Coop allocates his budget of \$120 to purchase two goods, T-shirts and CD rentals. A T-shirt costs \$8 and a CD rental costs \$6. 

(1) Draw Coop's budget constraint. What is the slope of the budget constraint?

(2) Assume for T-shirts, $MU/P = 5$; for CD rentals, $MU/P = 4$. Is Coop maximizing his utility? Explain briefly.
