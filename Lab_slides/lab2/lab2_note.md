## Overview {.center}

**Economics:**

+ "Economics is the study of how people coordinate their wants and desires, given the decision-making mechanisms, social customs, and political realities of a society." (from lecture notes)

**Why we need to coordinate our wants and desires?**

+ Because resources are **scarce**, society cannot produce everything that everyone wants. . If everyone pursued their own wants without any coordination, we’d run into conflicts and shortages.
    
**(Micro)Economics (A bit more articulated):**

+ Economics is the study of how individuals (consumers, workers, firms) make choices in the face of **scarcity** —meaning resources (time, money, raw materials) are limited — and how these choices are coordinated through markets to achieve efficient outcomes.

+ Consumers: How do individuals decide how much to spend on different goods given their limited income?
+ Firms: How do businesses decide how much to produce and at what price given their costs and competition?
+ Markets: How do prices adjust to balance the supply of and demand for goods?


## Overview: Concepts to understand the individual's decision making {.center}

### Premise
+ Everything has a reasonable cost 
+ People are rational (People have well-defined goals and make decisions to achieve them)


### Key concepts
+ **Opportunity cost**
  +  If you choose to do one thing, you give up the opportunity to do something else as a cost. Trade-offs due to the scarcity of resources (time, money, etc.).
+ **Cost-Benefit Approach**
  + It is **marginal benefit** and **marginal cost** that matter in economic decision making.
+ **Normative and positive economies**







### **Groundwater Management Example: Preventing Depletion**

In the context of groundwater management, we can break down the concepts of **positive economics**, **normative economics**, and the **art of economics** as follows:

### 1. **Positive Economics: What is Happening?**
Positive economics focuses on objective, fact-based analysis without making value judgments. It aims to describe and predict outcomes based on observable data and economic principles.

In the case of groundwater management:
- A **positive economic statement** might be: "If groundwater is extracted at a rate faster than its natural replenishment, the water table will decline, leading to depletion."
- This is a factual, testable statement based on data and scientific observation, without prescribing what should be done.

Positive economics would also analyze:
- How current groundwater usage rates affect future water availability.
- The economic costs of depleted groundwater on agriculture, households, and industries.
- The impact of water pricing or regulation on groundwater demand.

### 2. **Normative Economics: What Should Be Done?**
Normative economics involves value judgments and recommendations about what *ought* to be done, based on opinions about fairness, sustainability, or social welfare. It introduces subjective views on what is desirable or just.

In the case of groundwater management:
- A **normative economic statement** might be: "The government should impose strict regulations on groundwater usage to prevent depletion for future generations."
- This statement reflects a value judgment about what is considered fair or socially beneficial and is not purely objective. It suggests what should happen based on a societal goal of sustainability.

Normative economics might also include discussions about:
- Whether current groundwater usage is equitable between current users and future generations.
- Whether water should be priced higher to encourage conservation, or if it should be subsidized to support farmers.

### 3. **Art of Economics: Bridging Positive and Normative**
The **art of economics** involves applying the knowledge from positive economics to achieve the goals outlined in normative economics. It is the practical application of economic principles to policy design and problem-solving.

In the case of groundwater management:
- The **art of economics** might involve using data (from positive economics) to design policies (from normative economics) aimed at preventing groundwater depletion. 
- For example: If positive analysis shows that higher water prices reduce groundwater consumption, the art of economics would involve recommending or designing an appropriate pricing policy that balances conservation with fairness for different water users.

It’s about finding practical ways to implement the "should" of normative economics, based on the "is" of positive economics. Policymakers might:
- Design a tax or subsidy system to encourage more sustainable groundwater use.
- Implement water quotas or caps based on empirical studies of groundwater recharge rates and usage patterns.

### **Summary of Concepts**:
- **Positive Economics**: Describes the economic reality, such as "Groundwater depletion occurs when extraction rates exceed recharge rates."
- **Normative Economics**: Expresses a value judgment, like "The government should restrict groundwater usage to ensure sustainability."
- **Art of Economics**: Applies positive economic knowledge to achieve normative goals, such as designing regulations or pricing policies to reduce groundwater overuse.
