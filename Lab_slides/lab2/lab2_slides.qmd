+ This week, we learned many basic economic concepts, and we will learn more in the future classes. One thing that I want you to keep in mind is that "Knowing is different from understanding.". 
+ Well, it sounds obvious. But, I believe that this is a critical insight for leaning something new. 
+ I experienced a lot of times that I thought I understood something, but I actually didn't. How did I know that? 
+ After taking a lecture or reading a book, I tend to feel I understand the material. However, once I face complicated questions in assignment, I often find myself unable to figure out where to start thinking and how to apply the knowledge to approach the problems. This is a typical situation where I know the concepts but do not understand them.
+ If you cannot use the concepts to solve the problems, it's useless. For example, even if you have a car and you know the definition of a car (a four-wheeled vehicle that is powered by an engine and is able to carry a small number of people), if you don't know how to drive, it's just a piece of metal.
+ Just having this mindset, your performance in any class will be improved.

## {{< fa list >}} Overview {.center}

### Key concepts:

1. Opportunity Cost
2. Cost-benefit Analysis
3. Economic Forces and Market Forces
   + Invisible Hand by Adam Smith
4. Normative and Positive Economics

:::{.notes}
+ Today, I will go over some important concepts that we learned in the class, which are ...
+ Among them, the most important concept is the opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis. 
:::

## 1. Opportunity Cost {.center}

### Background:

**Scarcity Principle:**

+ Resources (money, time, attention, energy, oil, water etc.) are limited, but human wants are unlimited.\
&rarr; So, we have to make choices over another option.

**Example**

Suppose you own a successful pizza store, and are considering opening a second location. 

+ What is the scarce resource in this case?

:::{.notes}
+ Let's start with the concept of opportunity cost. 
+ Before that let me introduce the scarcity principle, which is a fundamental idea in economics. 
+ In economics, all the inputs you need to use to do something are called resources. For example, time, money. Of course, natural resources such as oil, water are also resources because they are used to produce goods and services.
+ These resources are limited. Everyone has 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a year. You cannot have more than that. The money you have is also limited. 


+ time 
+ energy 
+ cost (rent, labor, equipments adn materials) 
:::

## 1. Opportunity Cost {.center}

The scarcity principle necessarily results in trade-offs. 

&rarr; If you choose to open a second location, you must give up the opportunity to use those resources for something else.

:::{.ideas}
::::{.ideas-header}
Opportunity Cost
::::
::::{.ideas-container}
The value of the next best alternative that must be sacrificed.
::::
:::


<br>

**Example:**

+ We decided to continue our education at the University of Minnesota. What are the opportunity costs of this decision?

:::{.notes}

+ Because of the scares resources, trade-off comes in when we make a decision. That is, whenever we choose to do something, we must give up something else. 
  + The fact that you have to give up something is same as saying that you have to pay the cost of the decision.
+ You decided to continue your education at the University of Minnesota. What would you do with all that time and college tuition money if you decided not to do so? 

+ With the money you spent on tuition, you could have bought a car, gone on a vacation, or invested it in the stock market.
+ With the time you spent studying, you could have worked, volunteered, or traveled.
+ That is the opportunity cost of your decision. 


+ Any decision that involves a trade-off between two or more options has an opportunity cost.

+ You would have probably gone straight into the workforce, and you would have earned money instead of spending it on tuition. 
:::


## 2. Cost-Benefit Approach {.center}

Once you understand the concept of opportunity cost, you can use it to make decisions using the  cost-benefit analysis or approach. 


:::{.ideas}
::::{.ideas-header}
Cost-benefit Approach
::::
::::{.ideas-container}
Decision-making rule is fairly simple: 
+ If the benefits exceed the costs, then the decision is worth making.
+ If the benefits do not exceed the costs, then it is not worth making.

:::{.column width=50%}  

::: {.callout-note}
## What are they?
[Economic forces]{style="color:blue;"}: anything that affects whole economies (e.g., unemployment rate, inflation rate, change in consumer's preferences, etc.)

[Market forces]{style="color:blue;"}: factors within a market that affect the prices, supply, and demand for goods and services.
:::

**How are they different?**

+ Market forces are part of economic forces. There are lots of other factors that can affect the economy.

## *Invisible Hand*


:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
+ In economics, we assume that individuals are rational and pursue one goal: [self-interest]{style="color:blue;"}.
+ Adam Smith's ["invisible hand"]{style="color:red;"} theory explains:
  +  How individuals pursuing their own self-interest unintentionally contribute to the overall good of society through market mechanisms.

:::{.notes}
+ Adam Smith is a 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist. The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, is considered the first modern work of economics.
+ In the book, he introduced the concept of the "invisible hand".
+ What is the "Invisible hand"?
+ In economics, we assume that ....
  + For example, individual consumer seeks to maximize their utility, and firms seek to maximize their profits. That it. 
  + They behave rationally and pursue their self-interest.

+ 
+  to explain how individuals pursuing their own self-interest unintentionally contribute to the overall good of society through market mechanisms.

+ In other words, the market forces can achieve the efficient allocation of resources without any central authority by theory.  

+ For instance, a business seeking to maximize profits may innovate or improve its product, benefiting consumers with better options and contributing to economic growth. This self-regulating nature of the market relies on decentralized decision-making, where the collective outcome, driven by individual choices, often leads to an efficient allocation of resources, even if no one is directly coordinating these efforts.

### Example: Nippon Steel's Attempt to Acquire U.S. Steel

**Background:**

In 2024, Nippon Steel planned $14.9 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel (valued at $14.1 billion) to counter the growing competition with Chinese steelmakers. 

**Result:**

+ The U.S. government, under President Biden, intervened to block the deal due to concerns about national security and protecting domestic industries.

**Economic Consequences?**

We'll see the economic consequences of this decision in the future.

## Rent Control Laws
A price ceiling on rent set by the government to protect tenants from high rents.
:::

<br>

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
### Consequences:

&rarr; The rent is set below what the housing market would naturally determine.

&rarr; Even though the demand is high, the landlords cannot raise the rent, resulting in large opportunity cost.

&rarr; The landlords have less incentive to maintain the property, or they may convert the property to other uses (like condos) that are not subject to rent control.

&rarr; This can create housing shortages and poor-quality apartment units.

[Positive economics]{style="color:blue"} deals with describing and predicting economic phenomena without incorporating subjective values, focusing on "what is."

+ e.g.) If the price of a good increases (keeping everything else constant), the quantity demanded will decrease.

[Normative economics]{style="color:blue"} involves value judgments and policy recommendations, focusing on "what should be."

+ e.g.) If the price of a good increases, the government should intervene to prevent the price increase.

## Key points:

Normative judgement needs to be based on the predictions of positive economics

+ e.g.), You cannot say "the government should intervene" without knowing predicted potential consequences of the intervention).

<!-- + Positive ecnomics is independent of any particular ethical position or normative judgement.
+ Normative economic and the art of economics cannot be independent of positive economics. It necesarily depends on positive economics. -->

:::{.notes}
+ Normative economics and positive economics are two distinct aspects or perspectives in the field of economics. They serve different purposes and focus on different questions.

+ These concepts were proposed by John Neville Keynes, a British economist, in 19 century.  
+ By the way, John Neville Keynes is the farther of John Maynard Keynes who developed the foundation for much of modern macroeconomic theory know as Keynesian economics. He is well known for "father of macroeconomics".

+ Positive economics:
  + Positive economics ....
  + So, basically, the task of the positive economics is to provide general principles that can be used to predict the consequences of any change in economics. 
  + For example, a statement such that if the price goes up, the quantity demanded goes down. This is the law of demand, and it is a positive economics. This can be tested by data.
  + In this sense, the positive economics is objective and scientific because it reflects the facts.

+ Meanwhile, normative economics is subjective. 
  + It involves .....
+ Normative economics:
  + involves value judgments and opinions about what ought to or should happen in an economy. It reflects personal beliefs, ethics, or societal preferences rather than objective analysis.

+ value judgement: an assessment of something as good or bad in terms of one's standards or priorities.

### Example: Groundwater Management

1. **Positive Economics: What is Happening?**

+ Groundwater depletion occurs when extraction rates exceed recharge rates.
+ Current groundwater usage rates affect future water availability.
+ Groundwater quotas reduce groundwater consumption.

1. **Normative Economics: What Should Be Done?**

+ The government should impose strict regulations on groundwater usage to prevent depletion for future generations.

1. **Art of Economics: Bridging Positive and Normative**

+ If positive analysis shows that higher water prices reduce groundwater consumption, the art of economics would involve recommending or designing an appropriate pricing policy that balances conservation with fairness for different water users.

+ Positive economics focuses on objective, fact-based analysis without making value judgments. It aims to describe and predict outcomes based on observable data and economic principles.

+ Normative economics involves value judgments and recommendations about what *ought* to be done, based on opinions about fairness, sustainability, or social welfare. It introduces subjective views on what is desirable or just.

+ The **art of economics** might involve using data (from positive economics) to design policies (from normative economics) aimed at preventing groundwater depletion.
