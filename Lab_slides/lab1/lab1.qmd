:::{.goals}
::::{.goals-header}
Learning Objectives of This Course
::::
::::{.goals-container}
To introduce you to **the economic way of thinking** and **how to apply it to real-world problems**:

<br>

Specifically, there are two key components to achieve this goal:

1. obtain the fundamental knowledge of microeconomic theories and concepts.
2. learn the skills to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

### Example 1: Trade-offs in Everyday Life 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%} 
It's Friday night, and you order a pizza. You are really hungry so you ate most of it (it was so delicious), there are only two slices left. 

Should you eat them now or save them for tomorrow?

### Example 2: Groundwater Pollution

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
In the Midwest region, there is a serious problem of groundwater pollution due to the excessive use of fertilizers. Because of this, the water quality in the surrounding residential has been deteriorating, causing health problems for the residents. 

<br>

[How should we address this problem?]{style="color:blue;"}

:::{.notes}
+ Trade-offs are everywhere in our daily lives, and it's the most fundamental concept in economics. Basically, we want to solve the trade-offs to achieve a better outcome.
+ Meanwhile, sometime, trade-off can be used to solve the problem. 

+ The problem of the groundwater pollution is a typical example of the trade-off. Assuming that the farmers are pursuing their own profits, they will use whatever amount of fertilizers they need to maximize their profits. However, this will lead to the groundwater pollution.
+ What is the solution for this problem?
+ We can use the melanism of trade-off to solve this problem. For example, we can impose a tax on the use of fertilizers. This will increase the cost of using fertilizers, and the farmers will reduce the use of fertilizers. This will reduce the groundwater pollution.
+ Or, we can subsidize the farmers to reduce the use of fertilizers. This will also reduce the groundwater pollution.
+ Which is economically efficient?
